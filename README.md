## Deadline and Submission

This is summative coursework and it will be marked. The submission deadline is **April 24th 2024** (**Wednesday of Week 10**) at **12 pm (noon)**. 

## Important sources of information

Before you start, you should read the documents available on Blackboard (in this order):

1. The **coursework manual**
2. The **game rules**
3. The **spec** (including the **UML diagram**)
4. The **getting started guide** (optional, but recommended)

When you're ready to implement the fine detail of the `Customers` class, take a look at the **time passes worked examples** PDF.

Other sources of information:

* The output of the **JUnit tests**
* The **Blackboard forum** (please don't post any code, it will be removed and sharing code in this way may be considered academic malpractice)
* The **lab drop-in sessions** on Thursdays, 3 - 5 pm in Kilburn LF31
* The **Live Q & A sessions** (for general questions only, questions about an individual's progress/errors/implementation cannot be addressed in a group setting). 

## Running the code

In this exercise, you can implement a console or JavaFX application as you prefer. The console application will not be marked. The JavaFX application is optional and will not be marked unless all tests pass.

We have provided a (near-empty) console application in your repository, we refer to this in other documents as the "driver". To run the provided driver:

```
> cd src/main
> javac BakeryDriver.java
> java BakeryDriver
```


## Running the tests

There are two ways of testing your project.

1. Locally on your PC. In your locally cloned repository, run the script `./test.sh`.
 
2. Remotely on Gradescope. Every time you upload to Gradescope, you will be able to see the outcome of the tests.
