### Magic Bakery

This was a quickly hacked together back-end for an assignment, on a module related to learning Java.

Admittedly, not that interested in Java, being a language so oriented around object (dis)oriented programming, so the code is *not* polished.

However, did figure out how to write stateless, functional style functions - see `SL.java`.

There is some multicore potential in the language, unlike scripting languages, given modern features such as \parallelStream()\, but I already know how to do the same kind of thing in Go, so didn't really look into their existence until this project was finished.
